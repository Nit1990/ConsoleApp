    //1.An array with values to sort.
   
    //2.An inner loop that goes through the array and swaps values if the first value is higher 
    //than the next value. This loop must loop through one less value each time it runs.
   
    //3.An outer loop that controls how many times the inner loop must run. 
    //For an array with n values, this outer loop must run n-1 times
